# Mana Engine

Game engine that compiles a React + Three.js + Tailwind game directory into a self-contained ES module, mounted via Shadow DOM for style isolation.

## Architecture

- `library/` — The `mana-engine` npm package: CLI (`mana build`/`mana dev`/`mana editor`), runtime (`mountGame`, `createScene`), and Vite plugins
- `example/` — Consumer example: host page that builds the game with `mana build` then mounts it via `mountGame`
- The CLI generates entry files in `.mana/`, runs Vite programmatically, and bundles React/Three.js/Tailwind into the game output
- `cssInlinePlugin` extracts CSS into a JS export so `mountGame` can inject it into the Shadow DOM
- `tailwindResolvePlugin` rewrites `@import 'tailwindcss'` to an absolute path because `@tailwindcss/vite` uses `enhanced-resolve` which can't find packages in bun's `.bun/` layout
- Dev mode mirrors Vite-injected `<style>` tags (filtered by `data-vite-dev-id`) into the Shadow DOM via MutationObserver for dev/prod parity
- Dev/editor HTML templates must NOT use `* { padding: 0; }` or similar unlayered CSS resets — they override Tailwind v4's `@layer`-based utilities

## Scene System

- Scenes are JSON files in `game/scenes/` (e.g., `main-menu.json`, `first-world.json`)
- Each scene has a `background` color and an `entities` array
- Entity types: `camera`, `mesh`, `directional-light`, `ambient-light`, `point-light`, `ui`
- UI entities reference React components by name via `"ui": { "component": "ComponentName" }`
- Entities can have `"scripts": ["scriptName"]` to attach behavior scripts
- The game component imports all scene JSONs into a `scenes` map and manages scene switching via `ManaContext`

## Script System

- Scripts are TypeScript files in `game/scripts/` implementing `ManaScript`
- Lifecycle methods: `init(ctx)`, `update(ctx)`, `fixedUpdate(ctx)`, `dispose()`
- `ScriptContext` provides: `entity` (Object3D), `scene` (Scene), `dt` (delta seconds), `time` (elapsed seconds), `rigidBody?` (RapierRigidBody), `params` (configured values)
- Scripts can declare `params: Record<string, ScriptParamDef>` to expose editable parameters in the editor
- `ScriptParamDef` has `type` (`'number' | 'string' | 'boolean'`) and `default` value
- In scene JSON, scripts are `ScriptEntry[]`: `[{ "name": "rotate", "params": { "speed": 3 } }]`
- Params are merged at runtime: script defaults are overridden by scene JSON values, accessible via `ctx.params`
- `fixedUpdate` runs at a fixed 60Hz timestep with accumulator
- Scripts are registered in `game/index.tsx` as `export const scripts: Record<string, ManaScript>`
- Scripts only run during gameplay (dev/prod/editor play mode), NOT in editor edit mode

## Editor

- `mana editor` launches a full editor with hierarchy, inspector, viewport, and console panels
- Editor source is split into modular components: `Editor.tsx` (main), `Toolbar.tsx`, `Viewport.tsx`, `LeftPanel.tsx`, `RightPanel.tsx`, `BottomPanel.tsx`, `widgets.tsx`, `colors.ts`, `scene-api.ts`
- Editor reads/writes scene JSON files via a Vite middleware API (`/__mana/scenes/:name`)
- Scene names are validated to only contain `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` characters (prevents path traversal)
- Scene selector dropdown to switch between scenes
- Hierarchy panel shows entities from the active scene; click to select
- Inspector panel shows editable properties (transform, camera, material, light, UI component, scripts)
- Cmd+S / Ctrl+S saves the current scene to disk
- Play/Stop toolbar buttons toggle play mode:
  - Edit mode: editor manages its own canvas, scripts don't run, UI overlay has `pointerEvents: none`
  - Play mode: mounts the actual Game component in the viewport with full interactivity
- The editor entry imports `Game`, `uiComponents`, and `scripts` from the game's `index.tsx`

## Game Component Contract

The game's `index.tsx` must export:

- `default` — The `Game` React component (default export)
- `uiComponents` — `Record<string, ComponentType>` mapping names to React UI components
- `scripts` — `Record<string, ManaScript>` mapping names to script implementations

## Scene Switching API

- `useMana()` hook from `mana-engine/game` provides `{ loadScene, currentScene }`
- UI components call `loadScene('scene-name')` to switch scenes
- `ManaContext` is provided by the Game component

## Commands

- `bun run all` — lint + format check + typecheck + test + build (the full CI pipeline)
- `bun run dev:game` — starts the game in dev mode
- `bun run dev:host` — builds the production game, then starts the host in dev mode
- `bun run build` — build library then example
- `bun run lint` — oxlint
- `bun run format` — oxfmt (write), `bun run format:check` (check only)
- `bun run typecheck` — tsgo
- `bun run test` — bun test

## Rapier Types

- `RapierModule` and `RapierRigidBody` type aliases are exported from `scene.ts` and `game.ts`
- These centralize the dynamically-imported Rapier types so scripts and the engine can use them without `any`
- Physics runs independently of scripts — if entities have `rigidBody` components, physics steps even without scripts attached

## Stack

- Bun workspaces, Vite, React 19, Three.js, Tailwind CSS v4
- oxlint + oxfmt (not eslint/prettier)
- tsgo (native TypeScript compiler, not tsc)
- All dependency versions are pinned

Whenever important changes are done in this rapidly evolving project, update CLAUDE.md and README.md with relevant information.
